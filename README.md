## AI Disclosure

Some parts of this codebase have been restructured and had small bugs fixed with the help of [DeepSeek AI](https://chat.deepseek.com/). I review and test every change myself before merging anything. The whole codebase was written by a freshly baked human from scratch.

For anyone who doesn't read commits: Copilot is **not** used here. It accidentally got added to the collaborators list after fixing a PR that literally just removed a space. I've since disabled it, and it has no authority over this repo, including reviews.
As for Codebuff AI, I never even had a subscription to it. I was just testing it out before realizing that, and it somehow snuck into a commit message.

Contributors can use AI during development, but every PR is manually reviewed before I merge it. I use AI myself for assistance, but I'm strictly against "vibe-coding" and don't allow unchecked AI output. I can't speak for how contributors use AI, nor am I responsible for it, as long as the PR does its job correctly.
